# Lamhat - Digital Photo Frame

_Turn your any digital devices into photo frame._

**Lamhat**: An Arabic word meaning "moments," capturing and displaying your cherished memories.

## Background

I have an old iPad Air 1st Gen that is no longer in use due to the lack of software update support. I want to repurpose this device as a cloud photo frame, allowing for remote management of the photo library.
